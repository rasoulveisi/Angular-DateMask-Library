## üì¶ Installation and Usage

### As a Library Dependency
```bash
npm install angular-datemask-library
```

### Import in Your Module
```typescript
import { DateMaskDirective } from 'angular-datemask-library';
```

### Use in Templates
```html
<input type="text" dateMask="dd/mm/yyyy" [(ngModel)]="dateValue">
```

## üß™ Demo Application

The library includes a comprehensive demo application showcasing:
- Date mask implementation examples
- Form integration patterns
- Validation scenarios
- Multiple date format demonstrations

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
